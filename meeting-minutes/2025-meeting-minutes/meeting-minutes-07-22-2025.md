He highlighted the importance of events like Cardano Codex and the upcoming Cardano Summit India. Hasitha emphasized onboarding new developers, particularly university students, rather than solely targeting established web3 developers.                                                                                  | Explore developer-centric marketing strategies, especially in regions with high developer activity (e.g., India).

| Developer Experience & Tooling                | Hasitha raised concerns about the perceived difficulty of developing on Cardano. Laura acknowledged this but stated that improvements have been made with Aiken, though the narrative needs to change.

He proposed a voting process for posts and offered to lead the initiative.
