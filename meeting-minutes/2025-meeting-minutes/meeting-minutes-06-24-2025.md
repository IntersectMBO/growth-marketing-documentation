| Topic                                            | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Action Items                                                                                                                                                                                |

| GMC Budget Process & Skepticism                  | Tim highlighted that previous budget proposals didn't land well due to skepticism about marketing within the Cardano community, especially from technical members. He stressed the need for a strong case for marketing's ROI in real metrics (transaction volumes, unique wallets) to secure future funding.   | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Ecosystem Survey Initiative                      | Tim proposed a broad ecosystem survey to gauge attitudes towards marketing, identify opportunities, and pain points to inform future budget proposals. A draft of questions was shared for feedback.                                                                                                            | Tim: Share the draft survey questions with the group via Discord or direct link after the meeting.                                                                                          |
| Survey Mechanics & Timing                        | Discussion included using Google Forms, Typeform, or HubSpot. Tim suggested releasing the survey before Rare Evo, discussing broad themes there, and using Rare Evo as a platform to encourage participation.                                                                                                   | Tim: Finalize survey platform and mechanics. Aim to launch the survey before Rare Evo, allowing at least two weeks for feedback.                                                            |
| Survey Audience & Data Points                    | The survey aims for a wide audience, including DREPs and project founders, with options for anonymity or follow-up interviews. The goal is to gather objective, quantitative data to build a stronger foundation for future proposals.                                                                          | All: Provide feedback on the top 10-15 most pressing questions for the survey within one week of receiving the draft.                                                                       |
| Collaboration with Other Intersect Committees    | Laura asked about alignment with other committees. Tim confirmed plans to share the survey draft with the Product and Membership Community committees to avoid duplication and gain broader support for the initiative.                                                                                         | Tim: Review the Product Committee's survey to avoid duplication. Share the GMC survey with the Product and Membership Community committees for validation.                                  |
| Cross-Committee Meeting (Tomorrow)               | Terence clarified that a meeting is scheduled for tomorrow to connect TSC, GMC, and Product committees, with a dual focus of connecting and planning for a joint committee meeting at Rare Evo.                                                                                                                 | Terence: Share details of the cross-committee meeting agenda and invite with Andy, Nadia, and John.                                                                                         |
| Attendance at Tomorrow's Meeting                 | Several members (Laura, Tim, Nadia) cannot attend the cross-committee meeting due to travel or prior commitments. John and Anuj confirmed their ability to attend.                                                                                                                                              | John & Anuj: Represent the GMC at tomorrow's cross-committee meeting and report back findings.                                                                                              |

| Tokyo Days Event Marketing                       | Andy expressed disappointment with the lack of external marketing for the "Tokyo Days" event, noting low attendance from outside the Cardano ecosystem. He emphasized the need for earlier communication and collaboration on marketing within the ecosystem.                                                   | Tim: Follow up with the IOG education team regarding the marketing of the "Tokyo Days" event. All: Explore ways to improve visibility and communication for all ecosystem-based activities. |
| Central Source of Truth for Ecosystem Activities | Tim and John agreed on the need for a central source of information for all ecosystem activities to increase visibility and attendance for smaller meetings and informal meetups.                                                                                                                               | GMC: Discuss potential solutions for creating a central source of truth for ecosystem activities in a future meeting.                                                                       |
| Latin America Education Team Success             | Jose shared positive experiences with the IOG education team in Argentina, highlighting successful trainings, government involvement, and significant impact due to strong coordination with universities and enterprises.                                                                                      | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                 |
