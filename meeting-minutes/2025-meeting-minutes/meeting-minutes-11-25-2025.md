| Review of Agenda                   | Laura presented the existing agenda: 1) Presentation on the Polka Dot survey (Natalie/Jashar), 2) New member introductions, 3) Indian Blockchain Week (Anuj), and 4) White paper next steps.                                                                                                                                  | Agenda confirmed by Tim.                                                                 |
| Polka Dot Survey Results           | Natalie and Jashar presented insights and recommendations from an extensive BD-focused survey done for Polka Dot, similar to the Cardano survey. They noted low BD satisfaction (2.8/10), lack of clear KPIs (75%), and minimal shared tools (90%).                                                                           | Use presentation as a basis for discussion; insights may translate to Cardano's context. |
| Key Blockers (Qualitative)         | The biggest blockers were grouped as: No Strategy/Northstar, No Structure (unclear roles), Scattered Coordination/Communication, and No Shared Collateral/Messaging.                                                                                                                                                          | Need to address strategy, structure, communication, and shared assets.                   |
| Recommendations Overview           | Recommendations were grouped into three buckets: Organizational Structure & Strategy, Messaging & Collateral, and Infrastructure (tools/systems).                                                                                                                                                                             | Three key focus areas for improvement.                                                   |
| Org Structure & Strategy Deep Dive | Discussion on the need for decentralized frameworks, having a clear BD entry point to avoid duplicated outreach, and providing clarity on roles/ownership (who does what). Jashar added that funding decisions (like the GV Treasury) are often detached from a central strategy.                                             | Strategy development needs to be decentralized and usable across the ecosystem.          |
| Targeting, Messaging & Outreach    | Focus should shift from "spray and pray" to targeted outreach based on data and research. Need a standard elevator pitch and shared, high-quality collateral (fact sheets, value propositions) that teams can adapt. Jashar emphasized an "outside perspective" on landing pages/org structure.                               | Create marketing/sales collateral based on thorough research.                            |
| Infrastructure & Tools             | Natalie stressed the need for a unified marketing and sales hub (central place for materials) that is self-sufficient and scalable for mass market adoption. Quick fixes included a BD ecosystem map and a single point of contact/Telegram group for BD.                                                                     | Centralized resource hub is key for scalability and efficiency.                          |
| Past Polka Dot Research            | Shaggy raised concerns that the Polka Dot comparison was done last year and asked for links to that work. Yoram defended the current presentation's value to new members. Wes clarified that this presentation is on surveying the community for a business development approach, which differs from previous budgeting work. | Shaggy was asked to share links. Importance of sharing past work was noted.              |
| Alignment with Cardano Vision      | Yoram noted the 2030 Vision committee is currently designing Cardano's northstar. He saw similar needs for: Marketing Messaging, Business Tools, and Coordinated Business Activities. Tim emphasized the importance of KPIs to guide the decentralized community and DREPs, working in parallel with strategic objectives.    | Marketing/Growth committee should establish a KPI-driven strategic framework.            |
| Enterprise Adoption Group Overlap  | Laura noted the shared focus with the Enterprise Adoption group (directory mapping, Cardano.org as a one-stop-shop, downloadable assets). The goal is to make the website the central starting point.                                                                                                                         | The Cardano.org website is being worked on to become the single source of truth.         |
| New Member Introductions           | Yoram (5 years on Cardano, focused on enterprise adoption/business tools), Maggie (CMO at Awen, working with Rare Media on unified brand), and Octavio (Cardano Ambassador, founder of Cardano.com and Governancepace.com) introduced themselves.                                                                             | Welcome to Yoram, Maggie, and Octavio.                                                   |
| Indian Blockchain Week (IBW)       | Anuj provided an update on the IBW Hackathon (Nov 29th-30th) with 430 shortlisted developers and a two-day Cardano booth. They are also planning a private VIP meeting for enterprises/policy makers.                                                                                                                         | Expecting new developers and enterprise engagement from the India event.                 |
