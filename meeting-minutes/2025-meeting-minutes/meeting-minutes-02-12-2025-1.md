| Purpose of Meeting             | JB to provide guidance and feedback on the draft marketing budget. Committee to offer initial feedback and insights based on their experience and industry knowledge.                                                                                         | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                                           |
| Budget Structure               | Budget organized by workstreams (e.g., events, paid media). Descriptions will provide a rationale for the budget numbers, including scope and potential activities. Line item RFPs will be issued after the overall budget is approved.                       | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                                           |
| Budget Justification           | Scribe team is analyzing publicly available information (e.g., other DAOs' budgets). Scribe has access to non-public marketing spend data from top crypto projects. Question of how to provide transparency without violating NDAs.                           | Scribe to provide links to publicly available data. Potentially offer NDA-protected Q\&A sessions for detailed inquiries.                             |
| Publicly Available Information | Committee discussed relying primarily on publicly available information for budget justification.                                                                                                                                                             | Scribe to focus on publicly available data for initial presentation.                                                                                  |
| Budget Revisions               | Scribe will recommend consolidating some line items and adding others (brand campaign, market research, checks and balances).                                                                                                                                 | Scribe to provide a preview of the revised budget to the committee before Friday's public presentation.                                               |
| Presentation Timeline          | Committee prefers to review the revised budget before it's presented publicly. Friday's public presentation may be postponed to allow for committee review.                                                                                                   | JB to confirm that the public presentation will be postponed. Schedule a meeting for committee to preview the revised budget.                         |
| Admin Budget & Accountability  | Need for clarity on the admin budget and oversight of RFPs and project execution. Discussion on the role of Intersect in providing vendor management and project management support.                                                                          | Intersect to provide more information on the tendering process. Potentially issue an RFP for subject matter experts to assist with project oversight. |
| Brand Video                    | Agreement on the need for a high-quality Cardano brand video.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                                           |
| Influencer Marketing           | Concern over negative community perception of influencer marketing. Clarification that the budget focuses on sponsoring high-quality projects that will partner with reputable influencers. Emphasis on quality control and avoiding "pump and dump" schemes. | JB to discuss the influencer marketing strategy in more detail with Gnobudy John.                                                                     |
