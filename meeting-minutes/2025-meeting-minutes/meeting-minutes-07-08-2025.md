She suggested Intersect should also leverage it.

| Presentation: Cardano.org Current State & Future       | Markus presented on cardano.org, highlighting recent additions like event pages, its open-source GitHub-based nature, and high search ranking. He detailed the "circle concept" for various Cardano websites (developer portal, CIPs, forum, etc.), aiming for a neutral, open-source platform to avoid content cannibalization and guide users efficiently.                            | Markus to share the GitHub repository link for event contributions.                                                 |
| Content Contribution & Moderation Guidelines           | Markus outlined rules for content contributions: support calls to action, clear technical breakdowns, journalistic summaries, and strict prohibitions against announcements, sales, private channel invites, self-promotion, superlatives, and plagiarism.                                                                                                                              | Committee members encouraged to contribute content aligning with guidelines.                                        |
| Community Survey Update                                | Tim provided an update on the community survey, developed with Ben. It features 18-20 mandatory questions and optional follow-ups tailored to user groups (e.g., DREPs, project founders). Logan from Builder DAO will help circulate it. The goal is to launch it two weeks before Rare Evo, using early data for discussions at the event.                                            | Tim to share the survey link with the GMC for testing and feedback by week's end.                                   |
| Enterprise & Government Adoption Working Group Charter | Wes questioned the working group's specific game plan beyond the charter. Tim stressed the need for defined deliverables to ensure purpose. Laura clarified deliverables would include a tactical strategy/roadmap for the year, problem statements, and a structured approach to formalizing community help for projects seeking enterprise adoption.                                  | The committee voted to approve the working group charter. Laura to communicate the approval to the working group.   |
| Cardano Logo & Brand Discussion                        | Terence proposed re-coloring the six central dots in the Cardano logo to represent core entities (Intersect, IOG, Pragma) as a symbol of unity. Laura expressed caution, highlighting the importance of maintaining brand consistency for enterprise awareness. Hasitha suggested a compromise: adding small colored lines around the blue circles instead of changing the main colors. | Further discussion on brand representation and potential design options to be held in a future meeting.             |
| Dapps Showcase Visibility                              | Hasitha requested the Dapps showcase be linked directly from the main cardano.org page. He emphasized this would streamline access for new users and provide valuable "free marketing" for ecosystem projects.                                                                                                                                                                          | Laura to follow up with the community team responsible for cardano.org to link the Dapps showcase to the main page. |
| Ongoing Website Improvements                           | Laura encouraged committee members to identify areas on cardano.org that need improvement, noting that the community team handling the site would welcome contributions and feedback from those with marketing expertise.                                                                                                                                                               | Committee members to review cardano.org and provide feedback to Laura for the community team.                       |
