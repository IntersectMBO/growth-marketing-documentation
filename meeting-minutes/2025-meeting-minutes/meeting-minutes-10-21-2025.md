| Hackathon & Token 2049     | Anuj mentioned they are hosting Asia's largest Cardano hackathon next month and has been busy with it, also attending Token 2049.                                                                                                      | Terence offered to connect Anuj with Abs Peak regarding an event potentially near the summit. Anuj will forward the event info to projects like Tol Jack Cast in Hyderabad.                                                                                                                |
| Webcam/Video Issues        | Tim apologized for a busted webcam, and Wes mentioned he was driving and would not be on webcam. Lara joined with her camera open.                                                                                                     | Tim jokingly suggested Wes had a hangover. Wes confirmed he was "behind the wheel."                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Agenda Review              | Wes noted there wasn't much of an agenda besides reviewing the survey results, but Terence indicated there were other items.                                                                                                           | Terence listed Day Zero (pre-summit) and the panel as other potential topics, and reminded Tim to register for the summit.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Survey & White Paper       | Tim and Terence discussed using an LLM to summarize the survey and drafting a white paper on Cardano marketing (not a full strategy yet) to be shared with the community before Christmas.                                             | The white paper aims to suggest a direction based on the survey, which overwhelmingly shows the community feels Cardano needs a marketing strategy.                                                                                                                                        |
| Budgeting for 2026         | Tim stressed the urgency of getting the white paper out to inform the 2026 budgeting process, suggesting the survey data supports allocating 8% or more of the budget to marketing/growth treasury proposals.                          | A key challenge is aligning the understanding of what marketing means and what it can achieve.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Brazil Summit Update       | Jose gave an update on the summit in Brazil, calling the energy "incredible." They are now preparing for the Buenos Aires summit (Wenocides) with only 25 days left until the November 15 deadline.                                    | The Buenos Aires event includes a Cardano developers training course with IoC Education, with over 60 registered participants. The event will be hosted at UVA, a top Latin American university.                                                                                           |
| Buenos Aires Marketing     | Jose detailed a massive marketing push for the Buenos Aires event, with partnerships with Cointelegraph, and presence from Intersect, CF, Midnight, and Emurgo (planning to launch a Cardano credit card).                             | Jose noted over 360 people have registered, many of whom are foreigners, and emphasized this is a major marketing opportunity that shouldn't be missed.                                                                                                                                    |
| Summit Success Metrics     | Wes offered congratulations, noting that the Latin American summits (Brazil and upcoming Buenos Aires) have successfully exceeded their KPIs, which bodes well for the overall budget commitment.                                      | Lara, as a participant, echoed the positive experience, highlighting the large number of new individuals from major companies and social studies teams learning about blockchain.                                                                                                          |
| Elections Deadline         | Jose asked if the deadline for committee candidates could be extended to allow the new, interested people from the summits to participate.                                                                                             | Terence and Tim confirmed the deadline cannot be extended further for the current term, but there may be changes next year. They encouraged socializing Intersect's work at the events and utilizing interested people for qualitative follow-up conversations on the strategy and budget. |
| Survey Data Demographics   | Tim presented the demographics: roughly 25% founders/project leads, 18% community advocates, 11% SPOs, and 7% DREPs, noting the results were not a "massive surprise" and show a level of consensus.                                   | The data indicated a high proportion of people involved in Cardano tend to advocate, evangelize, and educate.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Marketing Budget Consensus | Reviewing question 21, the data showed that despite the current allocation of about $12 million ADA (less than 5% of the total budget), a majority of respondents think Cardano should spend "a bit more" or "much more" on marketing. | The median support suggests a proposed Treasury spend for 2026 of between 9% and 14% of the annual budget.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Marketing Focus            | Reviewing question 50, the data showed the top priority is major crypto conferences, but also highlighted community-led regional events and vertical-oriented events as important.                                                     | Question 53 reinforced the need to launch strong consistent campaigns, showcase real-world use cases, and improve the developer experience.                                                                                                                                                |
| IO Research Collaboration  | Jose asked if anyone could contact the IO Research team about their new laboratory project with the UVA, requesting they coordinate the announcement/launch with the Buenos Aires summit team.                                         | Tim agreed to raise this with Fergie (from IO) on Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
