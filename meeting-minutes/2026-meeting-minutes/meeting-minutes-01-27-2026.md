* **Collaboration Intent:** Tim and Yoram agreed to move forward with exploring the Social Scaled framework using real-world case studies.

* **Case Study Deep-Dive:** Tim, Yoram, Natalie, and Jashar are to meet offline to walk through specific examples of large-scale leads and identify blockers using the proposed GTM framework.

| Welcome & Introductions         | Lara opened the meeting. Members confirmed audio/mic setups. Participants from various regions joined, including Reshan (driving) and Wes.                       | Meeting recorded for those absent; Natalie and Jashar made contributors. |
| Social Scaled Introduction      | Natalie explained the name "Social Scaled," a play on a global takeaway chain, emphasizing their focus on creative "market scaling."                             | Formerly known as Parody Technologies.                                   |
| GTM Agency Vision               | Natalie described Social Scaled as a lean Web3 "Go-To-Market" (GTM) agency. They handle strategy in-house and use specialists for execution.                     | Stay lean by design to ensure strategic oversight.                       |
| The "Translation Layer" Gap     | Natalie identified a major gap between high-level tech and empty marketing. Cardano lacks a "translation layer" to make tech meaningful to CTOs/procurement.     | Cited GMC survey regarding the need for unified messaging.               |
| Enterprise Readiness            | Discussion on the lack of enterprise visibility in the ecosystem despite it being a strategic priority. Enterprises require a specific, targeted GTM.            | Messaging must become more heterogeneous as adoption grows.              |
| Compounding Funding             | Natalie argued that current funding (Catalyst) often funds one-off projects rather than "marketing enablement" that provides long-term, reusable infrastructure. | Focus on "teach the teacher" models for sustainable impact.              |
| Commercial System Pillars       | Jashar outlined three pillars: 1. GTM Strategy/Tooling, 2. Functioning Enterprise BD, and 3. Founder Enablement.                                                 | Goal: Facilitate enterprise adoption at scale.                           |
| Case Study: Polkadot Sales Hub  | Jashar shared success in scoring 84 industry subsegments for Polkadot to determine ROI on engagement.                                                            | Created value props and pitch decks for specific verticals.              |
| Case Study: Lime (Germany)      | Jashar discussed how Lime won the German market by focusing on "credibility" and local presence rather than just B2C discounts.                                  | Localized presence is key to building trust with municipalities.         |
| Founder Enablement (Arbitrum)   | Jashar noted that even tech-heavy founders at Arbitrum saw value in GTM workshops once forced to attend and see the resource benefits.                           | Helps founders prioritize resources beyond just tech development.        |
| Coordination Challenges         | Yoram and Tim agreed that "coordination" is the biggest blocker. Leads exist, but the onboarding process is currently fragmented and complex.                    | Reputation risk occurs when leads are brought into an unclear process.   |
| Regional Hub Status             | Reshan and Lara clarified the status of regional hubs (e.g., Sri Lanka, Japan). Many Intersect hubs lost funding last year and are now self-funded or closed.    | Discussion on creating "successful" hub benchmarks with clear KPIs.      |
| Infrastructure & Business Links | Yoram emphasized that infrastructure wins (like DeFi budgets) must be better connected to business networks and the "Vision 2030" plan.                          | Example: Integrating MPC wallets like Utilla for enterprise adoption.    |
| Action Items & Next Steps       | Tim requested an offline deep-dive to apply the Social Scaled framework to real case studies. Lara to invite Natalie/Jashar to Product workshops.                | Lara will share workshop info via email/Discord.                         |
| Closing                         | Lara thanked the presenters and observers. Next meetings will return to survey results and KPI documents.                                                        | Meeting adjourned; Social Scaled confirmed long-term commitment.         |
