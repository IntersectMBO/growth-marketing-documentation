## Agenda 2.10.25

* ServicePlan Presentation
* ServicePlan Q\&A
* NCL Debate Update

## Decisions/Actions

**Decisions**

* **Proceeding without Quorum:** It was decided to move forward with the presentations and discussions despite not having a quorum, with the explicit understanding that no formal committee votes or binding decisions could be made during the session.
* **Strategic Market Prioritization:** The team agreed (conceptually) to focus initial marketing efforts on the UK, Germany, and Switzerland as the primary markets for the first phase of the campaign.\
  Agenda Deferment: Due to time constraints, it was decided to skip the Cardano Summit 2026 update and the full Committee Election briefing, moving them to the next meeting or a private sync.
* **Pre-validation Strategy:** Instead of Intersect submitting the marketing proposal directly, the group decided that Service Plan should submit it to the community with "pre-endorsement" and validation from committee leaders to increase the likelihood of DRep approval.

**Actions**

* **Meeting Coordination:** Lara will schedule a private call with Tim and Laura later this week to discuss the specific impacts of the April 2026 election cycle on their leadership positions.\
  Proposal Refinement: Service Plan, Patrick, and Tim will collaborate over the next few weeks to "hone" the marketing proposal, ensuring it has a clear "red thread" through the funnel before it is presented for endorsement.
* **Budget Tiering:** Laura and the Service Plan team need to develop a "stepped budget" or phased financial plan to avoid asking for a large sum at once, which might be rejected by the market or voters.
* **Lead Management Integration:** The Enterprise Committee and CF team will continue mapping the ecosystem to ensure the "Cardano Hub" can effectively tag and route leads (e.g., to builders like Mazoomi).
* **NCL Clarification:** Intersect needs to make its position clear as the budget administrator regarding the validity of the NCL under the new constitution to resolve community confusion.

| Meeting Kickoff & Quorum       | Lara opened the meeting. Tim noted that many attendees were absent due to the Asia time zone (Consensus Hong Kong).                                                       | The meeting proceeded for discussion, but no formal decisions could be made as a quorum was not met.                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agenda Overview                | Lara outlined the session: Service Plan presentation, Q\&A, Cardano Summit 2026 teaser, MCL updates, and the April 2026 Committee Election cycle.                         | Priority was given to the Service Plan presentation to respect their time.                                                                  |
| Positioning Strategy           | Julia (Service Plan) presented the core value proposition: "Cardano is the blockchain for serious business."                                                              | Focus is on moving Cardano from a "respected bubble" to the "first choice" for enterprises through evidence and infrastructure reliability. |
| The Cardano Hub                | The strategy centers on a "Cardano Hub"—a central point for proof points, news, and expert routing.                                                                       | The Hub is intended to be the destination for all marketing funnels to prevent "dead-end" engagement.                                       |
| Media Strategy & Dual Dynamics | Max detailed a "dual experience" approach: high-visibility digital ads (LinkedIn/X) combined with "in real-life" (IRL) presence at business hotspots.                     | Initial target markets identified: UK, Germany, and Switzerland due to high maturity and audience size.                                     |
| Audience Segmentation          | Max categorized targets into three pillars: Responsible Pragmatists (CTOs/CIOs), Public Sector (Compliance focused), and Long-term Builders (Entrepreneurs).              | Message tonality will shift from "proof-heavy" for pragmatists to "visionary" for builders.                                                 |
| Creative Concept & Headlines   | Andy shared creative directions, including headlines like "Boringly Brilliant" and "All bull, no s\*\*\*," designed to be "serious but not boring."                       | Two visual directions were proposed: one based on symmetrical node patterns and another using 3D dimensional "tokens."                      |
| Product Readiness Concerns     | Yoram questioned if the Cardano product and the market are "there yet" for such an extreme enterprise push.                                                               | Suggested that enterprises look for specific solutions (e.g., efficient money transfer) rather than "blockchain" as a broad concept.        |
| Lead Generation vs. Conversion | Tim and Patrick discussed the "devil in the details," noting that brand awareness is high-level, but the pathway from a lead to a specific solution provider is critical. | Patrick highlighted the current messy process of collecting leads via WhatsApp at events, advocating for the Hub as a structured solution.  |
