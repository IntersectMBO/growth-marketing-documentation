* WG Deliverables

## Decisions/Actions

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="141.23828125"></th><th width="223.41015625"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Discussion Point</td><td>Notes</td><td>Actions: Responsible / Note</td></tr><tr><td>Meeting Logistics and Charter Update</td><td>The meeting started with discussions about recording issues from the previous meeting and an updated invitation. A request from the GMC to add concrete deliverables to the charter was also discussed. The charter itself was approved by the GMC, with an addition of three deliverables.</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Improving Cardano.org for Enterprise &#x26; Government Visitors</td><td>Discussion focused on creating a dedicated section or entry point on Cardano.org for enterprise and government users to better guide them and highlight relevant resources. It was suggested to include a lookup tool or register of ecosystem companies that can support these entities. The possibility of using Cardano Foundation's website was raised, but Cardano.org was deemed more suitable due to legal restrictions on self-signup mechanisms. The need for clear criteria for listing companies and a more enterprise-grade appearance for the website was emphasized.</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Framework for Enterprise Onboarding and Adoption</td><td><p>The group discussed the need for an actionable framework to onboard enterprises, managing the pipeline of leads, and directing them to the best support, considering factors like time, geography, and language. The overall goal of enterprise adoption was clarified as driving the adoption and use of the blockchain. The idea of focusing on specific jurisdictions rather than a global approach was introduced, with the example of the EU's progressive approach versus the UK's difficulties with crypto. The role of the working group was defined as creating tools and frameworks, not directly onboarding.</p><p>It was highlighted there is a lack of actionable steps for onboarding interested parties. The question was raised as to whether the focus should be on partnering directly with Cardano or with Cardano entities, with the latter being the general consensus for driving transactional volume. It was suggested focusing on specific jurisdictions and demonstrating Cardano's real-world impact through grassroots projects.<br>Ermias Giovanni presented a detailed proposal for a "scalable lighthouse project" focusing on one region (Mina, specifically UAE) and one vertical (supply chain transparency with ESG impact tracking), emphasizing a "hunter play" approach.</p><p>It was suggested to add a fourth point to the deliverables regarding identifying favorable jurisdictions. Phil Lewis captured the suggestions for favorable jurisdictions and incorporated it into an ecosystem map. Pedro Lucas suggested including tools for identity and traceability in such a portal and offered to use the open-source committee space to assess more tools.</p></td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table>
