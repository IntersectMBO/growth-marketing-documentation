Gintama (part of the Bootstrap Marketing Committee) is active in growth strategies and governance.</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Working Group Charter Review &#x26; Approval</td><td>The draft charter was reviewed.

The GMC meets weekly.</td><td><p>Simo will request the GMC secretary to add the charter to next week's agenda. Also to share the charter with GMC members beforehand. </p><p>New participants (Alex, Joe, Ermias, Lucas) will review the charter before next week's GMC meeting and provide any major concerns.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Working Group Documentation &#x26; Communication</td><td>Simo noted that the working group knowledge base and meeting summaries are pending charter approval. He has sent Discord invitations to new participants. The group's work is strategic and idea-focused, aiming to identify partners for implementation.</td><td>Simo Simovic will create the working group knowledge base and publish meeting summaries online once the charter is approved. All communication will be via the Intersect Discord channel.</td></tr><tr><td>Sharing Approaches &#x26; Best Practices for Enterprise Engagement</td><td>A representative from Cardano Foundation (CF) presented their approach, detailing strategic partnerships (integrating ecosystem technology, case studies), internal tool development (Proof of Origin, Vidian, Reeve), and geographical focus (Europe, Dubai, LATAM). A team member emphasized non-cryptocentric conversations to address enterprise needs, focusing on data validation and identity layers, often driven by regulatory requirements. A third individual showcased the Academy's offerings (Blockchain for Business Leaders masterclasses, certifications, online platforms) for enterprise upskilling and lead generation, including their open-source content model with consultancies.</td><td><p>Laura will share her presentation (PDF or slides) in the Discord channel for access. </p><p>Phil Lewis will reach out to Murasaki to request a similar presentation on Emurgo's approach, especially concerning Asia and Africa. The shared document will be used to collect pain points and challenges in enterprise and government adoption.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Challenges &#x26; Future Focus</td><td>Discussions highlighted the need for tools to support solutions, the "crypto-averse" nature of some large organizations, and the importance of simplifying technical jargon. A participant with consulting experience stressed the need for business professionals to help decision-makers understand implementability and the value of specific examples.</td><td><p>Ermiasi will prepare a presentation for the next session covering Storm Partners' actionable plan, including involving their legal team for jurisdictional entry. </p><p>Simo Simovic will ensure all new joiners are properly on the meeting invite list. </p><p>Simo Simovic will reach out to IOG to encourage their participation in the group.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
