* Enterprise Enablement Program (EEP)

### Decisions/Actions

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="145.6796875"></th><th width="274.71484375"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Discussion Point</td><td>Notes</td><td>Actions: Responsible / Note</td></tr><tr><td>Meeting Time Change</td><td>Request to shift the meeting time one hour later (from Lucas, likely in South America). Joe (Venture Centre) expressed minor concern but was agreeable, noting it's one of the few working groups she can attend due to time zones.</td><td>Simo to move the meeting time one hour later.</td></tr><tr><td>Ecosystem Mapping</td><td>Laura requested everyone, including Natalie (due to her Polkadot experience), to review the current ecosystem mapping document/skeleton. The goal is to finalize categories and start implementation in Q1. The document needs to be easily accessible.</td><td>Simo to check the Discord channel and ideally pin the ecosystem mapping document for easy access.</td></tr><tr><td>Cardano.org &#x26; Discover Cardano</td><td>Laura discussed using Discover Cardano as the central hub for the ecosystem. Open-source structure means anyone can draft changes to the repo. Phil suggested following up with Tommy (involved with Cardano.org) about building more dynamic back-end capabilities and database integration.</td><td>Laura and Phil to set up a conversation with Tommy early next year (Q1) to discuss backend capability and database options for Discover Cardano.</td></tr><tr><td>Growth &#x26; Marketing Committee Strategy</td><td>Laura explained that the committee is shifting away from a difficult budgeting process to create a white paper with KPIs and main goals for the next couple of years to rally community/D-Reps alignment.</td><td>All participants to contribute to the white paper on KPIs and main goals (especially regarding enterprise adoption). Work on this will start and continue over the next 4-5 weeks.</td></tr><tr><td>Cardano Foundation as "Root of Trust" / Trusted Partner Network</td><td>Discussion on the need for the Cardano Foundation (CF) to use its brand recognition to help project implementers secure contracts, especially in early meetings. This would involve CF acting as a "root of trust" to vet and verify a network of implementation/service partners.</td><td>Laura to follow up on the Partner Framework set up by Sandro, which was recently presented to the executive team. The framework will outline criteria for community, implementation, and enterprise partners.</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing Material for the Recent Fork</td><td>Phil suggested using the recent network fork (which was quickly resolved) as a positive marketing tool to demonstrate Cardano's resilience and self-repair capability (proving its "longest chain" claims). Joe emphasized the need for materials deliverable via email/short deck, not just Telegram/Discord, for enterprise clients.</td><td>CF (Laura, IOG, and Intersect) to put together a blog post/one-pager/short deck that positively spins the recent fork as a proof of resilience for external audiences/enterprise clients.</td></tr><tr><td>Cardano Acceleration Program (CAP)</td><td>Nadia provided an update on the CAP and Enterprise Enablement Program (EEP), noting that Sam Vitma has been hired to lead EEP. CAP applications are open (DeFi, RWA, service providers) starting in March next year.</td><td>Nadia to arrange for Sam Vitma to present the full details of the Enterprise Enablement Program (EEP) to this working group in the next 1-2 calls.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Enablement Program (EEP)</td><td>The program is a structured, week-long process to take key enterprises to the pilot stage. The CF team will coordinate and handhold the process, bringing in implementation partners as needed. They will be highly focused and selective to secure 4-5 solid pilots. The CF has a venture hub fund for key infrastructure/integration funding, but enterprises must provide their own capital for the main pilot.</td><td>Nadia's team will develop and open-source playbooks and materials from the EEP for the community to use and scale the adoption efforts.</td></tr><tr><td>Need for Business Focus &#x26; New Blood</td><td>General agreement that while developers have built the infrastructure, the focus now needs to shift to business people and enterprise adoption. Laura noted that new blood and engagement with universities are necessary to prevent the ecosystem from "turning in circles."</td><td>Laura's team is planning initiatives with universities and new developers to bring new talent into the ecosystem.</td></tr></tbody></table>
