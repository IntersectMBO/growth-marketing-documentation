### Decisions/Actions

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="131.62890625"></th><th width="323.3984375"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Discussion Point</td><td>Notes</td><td>Actions: Responsible / Note</td></tr><tr><td>Cardano.org website review</td><td>• A review of the current state of the Cardano.org website took place, specifically the sections for companies and the showcase of projects. The site has a vetting and review process for listing companies and projects. The project showcase has numerous filters and a substantial number of projects listed. The process for adding a project involves forking a GitHub repository, which is then internally audited. A representative of the team that manages the website was present and stated they are open to improving the platform. It was noted that a specification document is needed to detail requirements for new features. The website is essentially an open-source project, where suggestions can be submitted via a decentralized voting process.</td><td><p>• Phil: Create a specification document to outline a new user journey for enterprise and government users, focusing on an ecosystem mapping tool.</p><p>• This document will be shared with the group for asynchronous contributions.</p><p>• Umar will then take the requirements from the document to the team that runs the website for discussion.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Ecosystem mapping tool</td><td><p>• The current website primarily serves developers and those looking at existing projects. The group aims to create a tool that maps the ecosystem for non-developer users, such as those from enterprise and government sectors. This tool would help users find relevant organizations based on their specific goals with blockchain technology. A funded proposal to document dependencies between developer tools was mentioned as a similar concept. The group wants to create a resource to map out capabilities and services offered by different organizations, including consulting services.</p><p>• It was noted that the main challenge will be encouraging organizations to actively participate and keep their information updated.</p></td><td><p>• Phil will create a Google Sheet to start mapping out services and capabilities, where organizations can tag themselves.</p><p>• The group will plan a campaign to encourage more organizations, particularly consulting firms, to join and provide their information.</p><p>•  Phil and the team will then determine how to best represent this data on the Cardano.org website.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Upcoming Events</td><td><p>• Token2049: A Cardano-branded booth is planned, featuring presentations from community projects.Several side events are scheduled, in partnership with other ecosystem participants.A stage session is planned with representatives from two key organizations to discuss roadmaps.</p><p>• Rio Tech Summit: Scheduled for October 15th, this event will be enterprise-focused.</p><p>• Cardano Summit in Berlin: The last week for early bird tickets is approaching. The summit will feature a "day zero" dedicated to community topics and a second part focused on enterprise use cases, particularly the intersection of AI and blockchain.</p><p>• Japan: A series of events and workshops are being planned, with major Japanese companies set to attend a Catalyst event.</p></td><td>• N/A</td></tr></tbody></table>
