### Decisions/Actions

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="146.3203125"></th><th width="245.23046875"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Discussion Point</td><td>Notes</td><td>Actions: Responsible / Note</td></tr><tr><td>Venture Hub Pilot Program</td><td>A participant from the Cardano Foundation provided an update on a pilot program aimed at supporting new ventures. Five ventures were initially selected, with three completing the program. The program's technical sessions, service providers, and mentoring were highlighted as key successes. Future cohorts will focus on integrating more sessions with successful founders and offering more hands-on group work. The goal is to use insights from these cohorts to develop educational materials on building businesses on Cardano.</td><td>Nadia Mannell: Share a blog post summarizing the Venture Hub cohort with the group.</td></tr><tr><td>GMC Charter &#x26; Oceania Strategic Plan</td><td><p>The WG Chair mentioned that a revised charter had been submitted to the Growth Marketing Committee (GMC) for review, but there was no update on its status. </p><p>A new community-led strategic plan for the Oceania region was presented, which will be submitted as a governance action. The plan includes a business development program, ecosystem mapping, community engagement, and a dedicated marketing strategy.</p></td><td><p>Simo Simovic &#x26; Laura Mattiucci: Follow up with the GMC for feedback on the revised charter.</p><p>Phil Lewis &#x26; Joe (Venture Centre): Share the Oceania Strategic Plan on Discord and gather feedback from the group.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Production-Linked Incentive Framework</td><td>A participant re-presented a proposal for a new funding model aimed at enterprises. This framework would be an alternative to Catalyst, rewarding businesses for demonstrable on-chain results rather than relying on community voting. The goal is to attract builders from both web2 and web3 by de-risking their initial investment. The presenter intends to further refine the proposal for submission as a budget item in the next year.</td><td>Gintama: Continue to refine the proposal for the production-linked incentive framework.</td></tr></tbody></table>
