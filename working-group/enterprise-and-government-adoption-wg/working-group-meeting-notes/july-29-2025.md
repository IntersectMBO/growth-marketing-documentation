## Decisions/Actions

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="126.49609375"></th><th width="244.140625"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Discussion Point</td><td>Notes</td><td>Actions: Responsible / Note</td></tr><tr><td>GMC Meeting Access &#x26; Charter Document</td><td>Simo to follow up with Tex regarding access to the GMC meeting where the revised charter document will be presented. Laura is likely absent from both meetings. Phil and Simo can join the GMC meeting to present the WG deliverables</td><td>Simo Simovic: Ask Tex to add WG Deliverables discussion to the agenda for the next GMC meeting.<br>Phil: Join GMC call to present the WG deliverables.</td></tr><tr><td>Storm Partners' Project Proposal (Enterprise Adoption in MENA Region)</td><td><p>A proposal was presented outlining a potential project aimed at driving enterprise and government adoption of Cardano in a specific region and sector. The proposal is at an early, collaborative stage. The working group was invited to provide input and consider how it might engage with or support the effort.</p><p>Discussion centered on the working group’s role in such a project:</p><ul><li>The group acknowledged that its primary function is advisory and consensus-building, not execution.</li><li>There was general support for the project as a promising initiative aligned with the group’s goals.</li><li>Questions were raised about how the working group, as a collective entity, derives value from supporting the project.</li></ul><p>The idea of documenting the project as a live case study was explored. The benefits of capturing the process in detail — including strategy, decision-making, and regional nuances — were widely recognized. However, concerns were raised about the time and effort required for comprehensive documentation and the need to clarify ownership and resource availability.</p><p>The potential to align the case study with existing educational initiatives, such as Cardano Academy, was proposed. This could offer a pathway to fund, formalize, and distribute the resulting knowledge in a structured format.</p></td><td><p>Ermias Giovanni: Follow up internally with the Storm Partners team on next steps for the project and keep the group updated. </p><p><br></p></td></tr><tr><td>Cardano Performance-Linked Incentive (PLI) Framework</td><td>Gintama proposed an alternative funding model to Catalyst, based on a "production link incentive formula" where projects receive funding based on achieved results (e.g., 50,000 real-time payments). This model aims to be faster and more efficient for enterprise and business development, circumventing the lengthy Catalyst process. It would require direct treasury withdrawal initiated by the Growth and Marketing Committee (GMC).</td><td><p>Gintama: Share the document on Discord for feedback. </p><p>All Members: Review the document and provide feedback to Gintama by the next meeting.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Ecosystem Mapping Tool</td><td>Lucas is working on creating a list of libraries and tools for Cardano. He suggested sharing a Google Sheet with the working group to start populating the list, with the eventual goal of integrating it into the cf.cardano.org website as a subset of existing builder directories, specifically tagged for enterprise use.</td><td>Pedro Lucas: Share the Google Sheet with Simo to upload to the working group drive for collaborative editing.</td></tr><tr><td>Integration with Adjacent Technologies (e.g., NetSuite)</td><td>It was  suggested exploring integration with existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems like NetSuite as an onboarding strategy for Cardano adoption. This approach focuses on marketing Cardano's value within non-blockchain events and ecosystems where enterprises already operate.</td><td><p>Umar Jan: Discuss with Cleo (Cardano Foundation) regarding NetSuite integration. </p><p>Working Group: Consider whether we want to incorporate "championing successes of integration into existing non-decentralized tools" into the current charter and future deliverables.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
