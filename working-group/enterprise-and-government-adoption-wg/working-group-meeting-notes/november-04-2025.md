* Venture Hub 2.0

### Decisions/Actions

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="136.71484375"></th><th width="313.88671875"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Discussion Point</td><td>Notes</td><td>Actions: Responsible / Note</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Updates and Working Group Status</td><td>A participant (Phil Lewis) confirmed they did not run for re-election to the IC or GMC, citing disillusionment and uncertainty regarding Intersect's future direction, stating a desire to wait until the new Executive Director is hired and settles in (anticipated April) before making a renewed commitment. Low participation in the overall committee elections was noted, especially concerns for the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). The timing of the call was noted to be problematic for some members due to Daylight Saving Time changes in Europe.<br>Individual (Phil Lewis) to wait and see how the new Executive Director recruitment and Intersect's strategy develops before committing to further roles.</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Cadano.org Ecosystem Mapping Tool</td><td>The group reviewed the functional requirements document for the Cardano.org ecosystem mapping tool (Ecosystem Mapping Tool, Directory, and Visualization Tool). The objective is to create a robust, self-service directory and visualization tool for onboarding large corporations and governments. Discussion included using different verification methods, such as peer assessment or trusting verification by established entities (like Emergo), emphasizing that trust needs to be established in the verifying party first.</td><td>Laura Mattiucci to follow up with Tommy (Cardano Foundation) regarding next steps, scheduling a separate dedicated call if necessary, to get estimates on implementation effort and timelines for the Ecosystem Mapping Tool.</td></tr><tr><td>Benchmarking and Enterprise Requirements</td><td>Participants discussed the need to benchmark the Cardano.org website against other successful chains (e.g., Solana, Polygon) to meet industry standards. Reference was made to a Discover Cardano survey (Gitex survey) which identified case studies (what is being built) as a top priority for enterprise onboarding, surpassing funding requirements. This emphasizes shifting the website's focus to showcasing real-world application value.</td><td>Individuals to use the Discover Cardano survey data (shared link) to inform priorities when developing the Cardano.org website and ecosystem mapping tool.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Business Development (BD) Pain Point</td><td>A participant shared a pressing challenge: a massive enterprise opportunity that requires immediate commitment and credibility from a recognized entity (CF, EMURGO, or IOG) before the G20 deadline, which is currently blocked due to unresponsiveness. The participant stressed the difficulty in coordinating the ecosystem to commit to large projects.</td><td><p>Joe to forward the pitch deck email to Laura Mattiucci (CF) for immediate internal follow-up with relevant foundation personnel. </p><p>The Cardano Foundation (via Laura Mattiucci) to check internally with the dedicated Enterprise Solutions resource (Umar) and commit to providing high-level support/credibility for exploratory meetings.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Accreditation and Credibility Service</td><td>A broader solution was proposed to address the BD pain point: the Cardano Foundation (CF) should offer an Accreditation/Business Development (BD) support service. This service would provide credibility and brand recognition to members (like Joe) who are engaging in high-level exploratory meetings with large companies/governments in their region, helping them "get their foot in the door." This may require the CF to perform due diligence on the engaging companies.</td><td>The Cardano Foundation to explore the concept of a formal Accreditation/BD Support Service to give recognized community business developers the necessary credibility when engaging large enterprises.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Onboarding and Local Currency Focus</td><td><p>A participant (Gintama) from a business background highlighted that enterprise needs often require localized currency solutions (e.g., Rupees stablecoin instead of USDM) and real-world utility, not just DeFi speculation. The solution is not for the Cardano ecosystem to create all stablecoins, but to provide tools and resources (technology, skilled teams, or partnering with specialized stablecoin issuers) so businesses can create tailored, localized stablecoin solutions.</p><p>The Working Group to emphasize that providing the capabilities/tools for localized stablecoin issuance and utility creation is critical for enterprise adoption, rather than focusing solely on general-purpose stablecoins.</p></td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>Venture Hub and Ecosystem Coordination</td><td>The Venture Hub idea was introduced as a potential solution for funneling enterprise interest and matching them with ecosystem builders. One part of the hub focuses on accelerator programs, and the other on enterprise engagement . An individual from the CF team is leading this, aiming for launch by December/January.</td><td>Joe to reach out to Nadia to get involved with the Venture Hub, particularly the enterprise engagement piece, to leverage the funds and matching capabilities it offers.</td></tr><tr><td>Developer Onboarding and Credentialing</td><td>A participant proposed a separate idea for developer onboarding: leveraging Vidian to issue NFT credentials to developers who complete hackathons. A portal would then connect businesses directly with these certified developers, bypassing intermediaries and encouraging new development.</td><td>The Working Group to explore the proposal for using Vidian NFT credentials for hackathon participants as a developer onboarding and business-matching tool (and compare it to existing platforms like Andamio).</td></tr><tr><td>Meeting Logistics and Budget</td><td>The next call is scheduled for November 18th (post-Summit). A participant suggested adding budget process and the need for a dedicated budget proposal for this working group's specific enterprise-focused work to the next agenda.</td><td>Joe to prepare a dedicated budget proposal for the enterprise/government focused work of the Working Group. Secretary to add "Budget Process and WG Funding" to the next agenda.</td></tr></tbody></table>
